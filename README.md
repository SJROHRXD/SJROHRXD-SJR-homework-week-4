##Project Description
This is a javascript quiz. The quiz beings when you select Begin! Upon button click, the timer starts and questions are generated. Answers are selected by buttons, both correct and incorrect answers will prompt an alert. The quiz ends when the timer runs out or the questions have all been answered by the user. There is then a prompt for the user to insert their initials and enter their High Score.
